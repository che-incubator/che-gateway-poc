## Che Gateway POC

This is a playground for POCs of the Che gateway and their performance testing.

The Che gateway is a mechanism to enable our single host strategy on OpenShift using
a custom HTTP gateway (aka reverse proxy) that makes the workspaces accessible on
a subpath of a public endpoint.

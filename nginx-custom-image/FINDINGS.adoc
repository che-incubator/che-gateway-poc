## Findings

We probably need to establish the route only after the service has a valid dns name
or we know the workspace pod IP. That is because nginx resolves the IP of the provided
DNS name (we use the service host name in this POC) while it applies the configuration
and refuses to apply the config if the dns name doesn't resolve at that time. This can
be overcome by defining the proxy_pass target as a variable but that in turn requires
an explicit "resolver" which is hard to specify dynamically. This would require a writable
main configuration what would be modified by the entrypoint.sh to contain the same resolver
as specified in the /etc/resolv.conf.

== HAProxy POC using a custom image

This POC is based on a custom docker image combining haproxy with our `cm-bump` tool
to automatically apply labeled config maps onto the filesystem and send a signal
to some other process.

The image is built from this: https://github.com/metlos/cm-bump/tree/master/examples/custom-image/haproxy
